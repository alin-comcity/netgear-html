            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              Our policy is to offer product warranties and to perform services only on products purchased from an authorized NETGEAR reseller and only accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase. If you purchase a NETGEAR product from an unauthorized reseller or if the original factory serial number has been removed, defaced or altered, this NETGEAR warranty will not be valid. <br /> <br />
              Unfortunately, there are some websites and dealers who claim to be authorized NETGEAR resellers but are not. Products sold on these websites or from these dealers do not carry a warranty from NETGEAR. When you purchase products from an unauthorized website or dealer, you are taking a risk because these products may be counterfeit, used, defective, or may not be designed for use in your country. Please protect yourself and your NETGEAR product by ensuring that you only purchase NETGEAR products from an authorized reseller. If you have any questions about authorized resellers, please visit our website.

            <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-8">
              NETGEAR warrants its products contained in their original packaging against defects in material and workmanship when the products are used normally for their intended purposes. <br /> <br />
All NETGEAR limited warranties begin on the date of purchase. PLEASE RETAIN A COPY OF YOUR RECEIPT AS PROOF OF PURCHASE. The length of the limited warranty will vary depending upon the NETGEAR product you bought. Please see the product detail pages on netgearstore.com.bd to determine the warranted period for your specific NETGEAR product. <br /> <br />
All NETGEAR warranties (as opposed to statutory guarantees or non-excludable statutory warranties), including any implied warranties, are valid only for the period of time the NETGEAR product is owned by the “original purchaser” of the product. The “original purchaser,” for the purposes of this warranty, is the first purchaser of the product from NETGEAR or a NETGEAR authorized reseller. All NETGEAR limited warranties, including lifetime warranties, are not transferable. <br /> <br />
There are some components of current NETGEAR products, such as hard drives, batteries, and power supplies that will have warranty lengths that differ from the underlying NETGEAR product. <br /> <br />
TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THIS WARRANTY AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

            <p class="leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-8">
              This warranty does not apply if the NETGEAR product fails due to damage from shipment, handling, storage, accident, abuse or misuse, or if it has been used or maintained in a manner not conforming to product manual instructions, has been modified in any way, or has had any serial number removed or defaced. For NETGEAR products that can use replaceable batteries, use of only high-quality, non-counterfeit, and non-rechargeable batteries is recommended. In these products, the use of rechargeable batteries or inferior-quality batteries that cause damage to your NETGEAR product will void this warranty. Repair or modification of the product by anyone other than NETGEAR or a NETGEAR approved agent will void this warranty.
